# Crystal Collector Game

Caleb Myers

### Overview

This is a guessing game where the objective is for the user to have their amount in the "Total Score" section reach the number in the "Goal" section.

The "Goal" number is randomized between 19-120 each time the game is reset.

The four crystal buttons in the "You Pick" section will add to the user's "Total Score". These four buttons also have randomized values between 1-12 that change each time the game is reset. The user will have to test the buttons with trial and error to figure out how to reach the "Goal" number.

If the user's "Total Score" reaches the "Goal" number without going over it, the user wins the round.

If the user's "Total Score" goes over the "Goal" number, the user loses the round.

Each win or loss is recorded and the numbers in the "Wins / Losses" section will update each round

When the user either wins or loses, the game resets. This sets the "Goal" number and each of the values for the four crystal buttons to new randomized values. The user's "Total Score" will be reset to 0, and they can play again.

See how many wins you can get!
